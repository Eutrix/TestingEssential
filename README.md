# ForgeTemplate for Kotlin and with Essential somewhere in there
Code stolen with â™¥ from:

[Asbyth](https://github.com/asbyth) - [ForgeTemplate](https://github.com/asbyth/ForgeTemplate)

[Gravby](https://github.com/ThatGravyboat) - A lot of things from [RewardClaim](https://github.com/ThatGravyBoat/RewardClaim)

[Tyman](https://github.com/TymanWasTaken) - Workflow for Github Actions

[Chachy](https://github.com/ChachyDev) - [Hello, World!](https://github.com/ChachyDev/KotlinForgeTemplate) Because I literally can't code.
